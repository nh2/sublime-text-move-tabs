Move Tabs
=========

Moves tabs in Sublime Text, like in Google Chrome.


Keybindings
-----------

The default keybindings on Linux and Windows are:

*Ctrl+Shift+Page Up/Down* for moving tabs left/right.

For mac users:
Fn-up/down arrow is equivalent to pgup/down. This means that using ctrl-shift-fn-up/down arrow is what you need!
